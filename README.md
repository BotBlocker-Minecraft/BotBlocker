<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

BotBlocker is a solution for Minecraft servers designed to limit bot intrusion. It is available for both Bukkit/Spigot Minecraft servers and as a Fabric mod. If a user logs out too quickly after joining (indicating they might be a bot), the user is banned. This approach limits the number of login attempts from each UUID, effectively mitigating the consequences of a bot attack.

### Built With

* ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
* [Bukkit/Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org)

## Versions of the Project
[Bukkit/Spigot BotBlocker](https://github.com/BotBlocker-Minecraft/BotBlocker)

[Fabric BotBlocker](https://github.com/BotBlocker-Minecraft/BotBlocker-Fabric)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


## Functionality

### Initialization
When the server starts, BotBlocker initializes its configuration files (`config.yml` and `players.yml`). The initial default time limit for joining and leaving is set to 20 seconds. A message indicating the mod has successfully loaded with the set time limit is logged to the console.

### Player Join
When a player joins, if BotBlocker is enabled and the player is not already exempt from BotBlocker's checks, the mod/plugin records the player's UUID and the current time.

### Player Quit
When a player quits, BotBlocker calculates the duration of their connection. If this time is less than the set time limit and BotBlocker is enabled, the player is considered a bot. They get banned and a ban entry is added to the `players.yml` file. A disconnect message is sent to the player and a message is logged to the console. If the player stays longer than the time limit, they are deemed a legitimate player. Their UUID is added to the `players.yml` file as exempt.

### Commands
* `/BotBlocker enable` - Enables BotBlocker.
* `/BotBlocker disable` - Disables BotBlocker.
* `/BotBlocker setTimeLimit [seconds]` - Sets the time limit for detecting bots.

### Configuration Files
BotBlocker maintains its configuration and the list of player UUIDs in `config.yml` and `players.yml` files, respectively.

Note: Players identified as legitimate are marked as such in the `players.yml` file and are not checked again in the future. If BotBlocker is disabled, it stops checking players for potential bot activity.
